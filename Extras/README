Extras:
-------

Two "extra" programs provided more for my convenience
than anything else.

expire.pl - to be run via a cron job every night, of
however often floats your boat. Removed old events
from the datebook file, where "old" is defined by
$Config->{old} in the HyperCal.pl file.

todaySSI.cgi - as the name implies, this is a script
to be run by SSI, which prints a list of events that
fall on "today".
