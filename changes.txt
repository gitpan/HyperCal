Version 3.1 - August 29, 1998

For reasons mostly evident to myself, I have reduced
the number of files in this distribution. There are 
now three CGI files - index.cgi, event.cgi, and 
announcement.cgi

index.cgi contains the display routines.
event.cgi contains admin routines for adding, removing,
and editing events.
announcement.cgi contains admin routines for adding,
removing, and editing announcements.

This has a few main effects:

1) Less hassle for me trying to keep up with 10 files.
2) Scripts are divided into "user" and "admin" scripts.
this lets the admin decide whether the user should have
access to add/delete/edit events and/or announcements,
and password protect the relevant file accordingly.
3) If new display routines (such as Year view, or weekly
view) need to be added, this can be done by just adding
a new subroutine to index.cgi, and modifying @Actions.
4) The name "index.cgi" lends itself to being the
default document in a directory.

Apart from that, there are really no major changes 
from version 3.03, except that all scripts use strict
'vars', and actually pass -cw tests. Hopefully, the
documentation is a little better, too.

There were several bugs in the previous version, that
just happened to work because I was quite cavalier about
using global variables, so occasionally it just worked
by sheer luck. Odd, that.

Oh, yeah, and I have combined some of the common code
into HyperCal.pm. The Time::* modules are still needed.

Finally, all of the configuration options in HyperCal.pm
have been put into a single data structure %Config, just
for the sake of not exporting 23 variables.

This new version will still run with your existing
datafiles, although you will want to rename 
hypercal_id to datebook.id, and announce_id to 
announce.id  Hopefully, that is not too much of a hassle.

Version 3.03

Better documentation and installation information,
to make the CPAN distribution a little more palatable.
Very minor changes.

Version 3.02 - July 2, 1998
Minor bug fix. I had the wrong variable, and it
was causing dates to be dropped.

Version 3.01 - May 3, 1998
Minor change - someone requested that I put back 
in a feature I used to have, where the number of
events, rather than the text of those events, 
was listed on the calendar.  What I did, since 
people want it both ways, was to make this a
configurable option in HyperCal.pm

Version 3.0 - March 1998
Code made more readable and more portable.  Much
of the functionality moved out into a pm file.
Database structure changed substantially.
Time handling moved to standard Perl modules, 
rather than my own home-grown routines, for
added readability, portability, and reliability.
And, when leap-year calculations fail, I can 
blame it on someone else.

Version 2.3 - October, 1995
Hacked together to see if I could.  Remained
largely unchanged since then.  The version
number, if I recall correctly, was just made 
up to make it look older than it was.
